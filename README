Vim processing.

This is an extension of vim script #2115. It started simply as an easy git repo
to bundle and use with pathogen, but has grown as I use processing more.

I have made two sets of modifications so far:

1) Documentiation is now browsable locally or on the web. If you set the
variable processing_doc_style to "local" it will use a local copy of the
processing docs (and requires you to set the variable processing_doc_path to
point to the root of the documents). If you set processing_doc_style to "web"
it will point your browser at the processing site when you use attempt to use
the documentation hookup.  (normal mode K)

2) For OSX users, processing-java is used to used to run the script in question.
For this to work, you need to install processing-java by opening Processing then
selecting 'Install "processing-java"' from the Tools menu. Having done this,
press F5 in Vim to run the current sketch. Alternately, you can call the command
:RunProcessing, or bind that command to a key of your choosing.
